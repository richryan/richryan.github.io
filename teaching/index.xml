      <description> Materials for Macroeconomic Theory I, ECON 605, with Professors Dmitriy Stolyarov and John Leahy.
The improved Fall 2017 notes represent meaningful learning on my part&amp;mdash;many of the details are smoothed out in the updated notes. I preserve the Fall 2016 notes as a reference to those who used them. The preservation also represents a desire not to obliterate the hard work that went into them.
