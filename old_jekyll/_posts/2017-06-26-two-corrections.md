Two minor corrections were incorporated into the 605 notes.

<!--more-->

These were pointed out by Shawn---thank you.

First, in figure H5.5 of the Stolyarov notes,
consumption should jump up on impact and the economy should head in a northwesterly direction until the economy reaches the new stable arm at \\(t=10\\).
The economy will follow the original dynamics associated with the black directional arrows upon announcement
because the new growth rate does not take effect until \\(t=10\\).

Second, in the 605 Leahy notes the unnumbered equation in the last bullet on page 107
should indicate that \\(\beta\\) converts period-\\(t+1\\) utils into period-\\(t\\) utils.
While the text said as much, the offset equation did not.
Now it does.

These corrections have been incorporated into the 605 notes.
