Notes on the 607 final were added to the [ECON 607 Ottonello notes](https://umich.box.com/s/xczz87igzno3lzpfkapiurrp8izzivud).
They are included in section section 12, under the part titled "Odds and ends".

Section 12.1 is on the efficiency of directed search and relies on the ideas developed in section 8,
except that instead of wages being a fraction of output, wages are now a convex combination of output and the worker's outside option:

$$
\begin{align*}
w = s(\theta)y + [1 - s(\theta)] b,
\end{align*}
$$

where \\( s(\theta) \\) is the worker's share in creating a match.
Pretty nifty.

Section 12.2 talks about the "superneutrality" of a steady state where money is growing at a constant rate.
