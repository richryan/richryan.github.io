The charts are based on this NY Times article, which begins \u0026ldquo;The American economy plunged deeper into crisis last month, losing 20.5 million jobs as the unemployment rate jumped to 14.7 percent, the worst devastation since the Great Depression.\u0026rdquo;\nThe R code shared below replicates some of the charts included in the article. The charts are listed in the table of contents.1\nIt should be noted that the BLS published a statement on how the Coronavirus impacted the data from the April 2020 Establishment and Household Surveys. While the collection rate for the Establishment Survey was \u0026ldquo;essentially unchanged\u0026rdquo; from collection rates prior to the pandemic (partly due to a longer collection period), the Household Survey response rate \u0026ldquo;at about 70 percent, was about 13 percentage points lower than in months prior to the pandemic.\u0026rdquo;\nAs David Blanchflower put it for The New York Review of Books: \u0026ldquo;The data are hard to interpret because any idea of \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; has gone out of the window.\u0026rdquo; Blanchflower points out that the data from the Establishment Survey does not include the self-employed.\nTable of Contents  Monthly change in jobs Unemployment rate Share of the population that is employed Share of unemployed on temporary layoff\u0026mdash;some hope   Monthly change in jobs The calculation of the monthly change in jobs uses data from the Establishment Survey. From the BLS: \u0026ldquo;In the establishment survey, workers who are paid by their employer for all or any part of the pay period including the 12th of the month are counted as employed, even if they were not actually at their jobs. Workers who are temporarily or permanently absent from their jobs and are not being paid are not counted as employed, even if they are continuing to receive benefits. The length of the reference period does vary across the respondents in the establishment survey; one-third of businesses have a weekly pay period, slightly over 40 percent a bi-weekly, about 20 percent semi-monthly, and a small amount monthly.\u0026rdquo;\n# Load packages library(tidyverse) library(tidyquant) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) # Chart parameters mygray \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;gray66\u0026quot; # Data for recession shading recess \u0026lt;- tq_get(\u0026quot;USRECM\u0026quot;, get = \u0026quot;economic.data\u0026quot;, from = \u0026quot;1800-01-01\u0026quot;) tail(recess)  ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## symbol date price ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 USRECM 2019-11-01 0 ## 2 USRECM 2019-12-01 0 ## 3 USRECM 2020-01-01 0 ## 4 USRECM 2020-02-01 0 ## 5 USRECM 2020-03-01 0 ## 6 USRECM 2020-04-01 0  recess_dat \u0026lt;- recess %\u0026gt;% arrange(date) %\u0026gt;% mutate(same = 1 - (price == lag(price))) %\u0026gt;% # Remove first row, an NA, for cumulative sum filter(date \u0026gt; min(recess$date)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(era = cumsum(same)) %\u0026gt;% # Filter only recessions filter(price == 1) recess_dat \u0026lt;- recess_dat %\u0026gt;% group_by(era) %\u0026gt;% # Unncessary, but to be sure... arrange(date) %\u0026gt;% filter(row_number() == 1 | row_number() == n()) # Now reshape the data wide. # Each row will contain the start and end dates of a recession. recess_dat \u0026lt;- recess_dat %\u0026gt;% mutate(junk = row_number()) %\u0026gt;% mutate(begin_end = case_when( junk == 1 ~ \u0026quot;begin\u0026quot;, junk == 2 ~ \u0026quot;end\u0026quot; )) recess_wide \u0026lt;- recess_dat %\u0026gt;% ungroup() %\u0026gt;% select(symbol, price, date, era, begin_end) %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = begin_end, values_from = date) # All Employees, Total Nonfarm payems \u0026lt;- tq_get(\u0026quot;PAYEMS\u0026quot;, get = \u0026quot;economic.data\u0026quot;, from = \u0026quot;1800-01-01\u0026quot;) payems \u0026lt;- payems %\u0026gt;% # Convert to millions mutate(price = price / 1000, change_jobs = price - lag(price), mycat = date == max(date)) %\u0026gt;% filter(!is.na(change_jobs)) payems \u0026lt;- payems %\u0026gt;% left_join(recess, by = \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(neg = change_jobs \u0026lt; 0) last_date \u0026lt;- max(payems$date) last_lvl \u0026lt;- payems$change_jobs[[which(payems$date == last_date)]] segment_height \u0026lt;- 1.5 # Set up labels for y axis my_breaks \u0026lt;- c(seq(1, -2), seq(-5, -20, by= -5)) my_labels \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;+1 million\u0026quot;, paste(c(seq(0, -2), seq(-5, -20, by= -5)))) # Plot ggplot(data = payems) + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = date, y = change_jobs, color = neg, fill = neg)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = my_breaks, labels = my_labels) + # Color the bars scale_fill_manual(values = c(mygray, \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;)) + scale_color_manual(values = c(mygray, \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) ) + # Label last observation annotate(\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, x = last_date - 12*100, y = 3.0, label = paste(last_lvl, \u0026quot;million\u0026quot;), color = \u0026quot;red\u0026quot;) + annotate(\u0026quot;segment\u0026quot;, x = last_date, xend = last_date, y = 0, yend = 2.5, linetype = \u0026quot;dashed\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + # Turn off legend guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Monthly change in jobs\u0026quot;) + # theme_pander() theme_wsj(base_family = \u0026quot;sans\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot;, title_family = \u0026quot;sans\u0026quot;, base_size = 8) + # Put grid lines on top theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA), panel.ontop = TRUE)  Unemployment rate Data used to calculate the unemployment rate come from the Current Population Survey or Household Survey.

Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\u0026rdquo;\nFor April 2020, the reference week was from April 12 through April 18th. \u0026ldquo;Workers who indicate they were not working during the entire survey reference week and expect to be recalled to their jobs should be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff.\u0026rdquo;\nTemporary layoff is one of the categories used by the BLS to classify the unemployed. The BLS uses the following categories:\n Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs  On temporary layoff Not on temporary layoff  Permanent job losers Persons who completed temporary jobs   Job leavers Reentrants\n New entrants  The chart in this section depicts the share of unemployed on temporary layoff. To be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, a person has either been given a date to return to work by their employer or expects to be recalled to their job within 6 months. From the BLS: \u0026ldquo;If, because of the coronavirus, a person was uncertain of when they would be able to return to work and thus was unsure of how to answer the question, the interviewer was instructed to enter a response of \u0026lsquo;yes,\u0026rsquo; rather than \u0026lsquo;don’t know.\u0026rsquo; This would allow the individual to be included among the unemployed on temporary layoff.\u0026rdquo; In other words, this was \u0026ldquo;an attempt to classify people who were effectively laid off due to pandemic-related closures among the unemployed on temporary layoff.\u0026rdquo;\nSome unemployed people on temporary layoff may also have received pay from their employer: \u0026ldquo;Under the guidance provided to the household survey interviewers, workers who indicate that they were not working during the entire reference week due to efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus should be classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, whether or not they are paid for the time they were off work.\u0026rdquo;\nWith this caveat, from the NY Times article: \u0026ldquo;It remains possible that the recovery, too, will be swift, and that as the pandemic retreats, businesses that were fundamentally healthy before the virus will reopen, rehire and return more or less to normal. The one bright spot in Friday’s report was that nearly 80 percent of the unemployed said they had been temporarily laid off and expected to return to their jobs in the coming months.\u0026rdquo;\nloss_series \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;LNS13023653\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;UNEMPLOY\u0026quot;) loss \u0026lt;- tq_get(loss_series, get = \u0026quot;economic.data\u0026quot;, from = \u0026quot;1900-01-01\u0026quot;) # Rename for ease loss \u0026lt;- loss %\u0026gt;% mutate(series_name = case_when( symbol == \u0026quot;UNEMPLOY\u0026quot; ~ \u0026quot;unemp\u0026quot;, symbol == \u0026quot;LNS13023653\u0026quot; ~ \u0026quot;layoff\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% select(-symbol) # Reshape wide loss \u0026lt;- loss %\u0026gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = series_name, values_from = price) # Create share of unemployed on temporary layoff loss \u0026lt;- loss %\u0026gt;% mutate(share = 100*layoff / unemp) %\u0026gt;% drop_na(share) # Last observation last_date \u0026lt;- max(loss$date) last_lvl \u0026lt;- loss$share[[which(loss$date == last_date)]] last_lvl \u0026lt;- round(last_lvl, 1) # Scale my_breaks \u0026lt;- seq(10, 80, by = 10) my_labels \u0026lt;- paste(seq(10, 70, by = 10)) my_labels \u0026lt;- c(my_labels, \u0026quot;80%\u0026quot;) ggplot(data = loss) + # Add recession shading geom_rect(data = filter(recess_wide, begin \u0026gt;= min(loss$date)), mapping = aes(xmin = begin, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf), fill = mygray, alpha = 0.7) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y = share), size = 0.8, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + # Highlight last observation geom_point(data = filter(loss, date == last_date), mapping = aes(x = date, y = share), size = 3) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Share of unemployed on temporary layoff\u0026quot;) + # Label y-axis for wsj theme scale_y_continuous(breaks = my_breaks, labels = my_labels) + # Make sure start at 0% expand_limits(y = 0) + # Label last observation annotate(\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;, x = last_date, y = last_lvl + 5, label = paste0(last_lvl, \u0026quot;%\u0026quot;), color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + # Use sans serif font instead of mono, use gray color theme_wsj(base_family = \u0026quot;sans\u0026quot;, color = \u0026quot;gray\u0026quot;, title_family = \u0026quot;sans\u0026quot;, base_size = 8)   The BLS\u0026rsquo;s May 12 Economics Daily chart discusses the drop in payroll employment in April 2020. ^   ","date":1588982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588982400,"objectID":"4ed8002b87556964231aa862c7b4ae41","permalink":"/2020/05/09/labor-market-friday/","publishdate":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2020/05/09/labor-market-friday/","section":"post","summary":"Here are data from the latest Employment Situation.

It depends.\nBackground on the CES Usually on the first Friday of each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data on current employment in the \u0026ldquo;Employment Situation.\u0026rdquo; The quoted level of employment comes from the Current Employment Statistics survey, aka the establishment or payroll survey.\nGetting data on the level of employment should be doable because these data are collected for tax purposes. \u0026ldquo;Unemployment Insurance (UI) is a federal\u0026ndash;state program jointly financed through Federal and state employer payroll taxes (federal/state UI tax). Generally, employers must pay both state and Federal unemployment taxes if: (1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500, or more, in any quarter of a calendar year; or, (2) they had at least one employee during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether or not the weeks were consecutive. However, some state laws differ from the Federal law and employers should contact their state workforce agencies to learn the exact requirements.\u0026rdquo;1 In Rhode Island, for example, employers of one or more workers are subject to the Employment Security and the Temporary Disability Insurance Acts. Anyone subject to these acts will be taxed and have their data collected by the state of RI. These data are then compiled by the state of Rhode Island and reported to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in something called the ES-202 Report.\nFrom these state-level data, which are at the UI account number, the CES creates a sampling frame. The CES sampling method is based on state, industry, and employment size\u0026mdash;in other words, the CES wants to make sure it\u0026rsquo;s hitting industry and employment numbers at the state level. The sample is updated twice a year using updated UI-based universe data, providing information on firm births and deaths, which is something macroeconomists are into.2\nOnce the sampling frame is set, the BLS attempts to collect data from the sample of establishments. The BLS encourages participation by tailoring their data collection to what the firm prefers. Initially each firm is called. Then data are collected according to something called Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing, which hopefully leads to self-reporting.\nFun fact: \u0026ldquo;Very large, multiestablishment firms are often enrolled via personal visit, and ongoing reporting is established via electronic data interchange,\u0026rdquo; which are apparently \u0026ldquo;electronic files.\u0026rdquo;3\nThe CES survey sample includes about 160,000 US firms and covers about 400,000 worksites.\nThat all seems perfectly clear, but the edges seem a little funny. For example, chapter 2 of the BLS Handbook of Methods states that domestic workers in private homes are excluded from the CES survey. But in Rhode Island, employers of domestic workers who have paid $1,000 or more in total cash wages in any calendar quarter are subject to UI tax.4 I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if the Rhode Island employers of domestic workers can be part of the CES sample. Also, the crew of a fishing boat made up of less than 10 people whose sole remuneration is a share of the catch are not counted. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is a state-level thing, decided by state legislators. This fuzziness might explain the 97 percent coverage rate of the CES.\nAnswer to the question If the 10 people running their own business in question 9 of Mankiw 9e, p 45 are paying UI taxes and the business is incorporated, then they are counted as employed in the establishment survey. If they own a fishing vessel in the state of Rhode Island and pay their crew according to a lay system (see Moby-Dick where Ishmael secured the 300th lay or 1\u0026frasl;300 of net profits\u0026mdash;Queequeg secured the 90th lay), then no.\nIf the person running their own business is doing it through 1099s or if the business is unincorporated, then they would not be counted in the establishment survey. The unincorporated self-employed are not counted in the establishment survey.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s why you could make a case that the answer to 9 is either 55 or 65.\nYou can read even more about the details in Mary Bowler and Teresa L. Morisi\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026ldquo;Understanding the employment measures from the CPS and CES survey\u0026rdquo; published in the February 2006 issue of the Monthly Labor Review.\n You can find more information here\r^ You can read about this is the BLS Handbook of Methods.\r^ So like a spreadsheet?

Which simply means that the decision maker is using newspapers, FRED, the internet, etc. to make a guess about what they think inflation will be. The decision maker has to make a guess because they don\u0026rsquo;t know what inflation will be between time \\( t \\) and \\( t+1 \\).\nNow think about a borrower and a lender deciding on the terms of a contract. The number written on the contract is a nominal interest rate (usually, not always). And to get that number they need to agree on a forecast of inflation. (The borrower may even welcome a high rate of interest if they thought their wages were going to rise significantly.) That means they have to form an expectation of inflation.\n\u0026ldquo;The real interest rate that the borrower and lender expect when the load is made\u0026rdquo; is called the ex ante real interest rate. As time passes and people make decisions in the economy, prices are realized, which determine the actual rate of inflation. \u0026ldquo;The real interest rate that is actually realized\u0026rdquo; is called the ex post interest rate. This can only be inferred after the fact. See p. 117 of Mankiw, 9e.\nWhen Chair Ben Bernanke came to U-M, he talked about \u0026ldquo;open mouth operations,\u0026rdquo; a play on open-market operations, which are the usual puchases and sales of government bonds that the Fed makes. Because interest rates were pinned at zero, Chair Berenanke talked about lowering real interest rates by increasing inflation expectations:\n$$ r_t = i_t - E_t \\pi_{t+1}. $$\nChair Bernanke talked about promising not to raise interest rates\u0026mdash;no matter what\u0026mdash;which would increase \\( E_t \\pi_{t+1} \\) thereby lowering \\( r_t \\). It was pretty clear Chair Bernanke had the Fisher effect in mind.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing deep behind the terms ex ante interest rate and ex post interest rate.

If the annual discount factor is \\(.99\\), then the 30-year discount factor is \\(.99^{\\text{years}}\\). The parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is standard and represents the factor share of capital. Population between periods evolves according to \\(L_{t+1} = (1+n)L_t\\). If population grows at a \\(.5\\) percent annual rate, the 30-year rate is \\( 1+n = (1.005)^{30} \\). Likewise, assume technology grows at a \\( 1 \\) percent annual rate.\nThe Python code that makes these calculations is:\nyrs = 30 beta = 0.99**yrs alpha = 0.25 n = (1.005)**yrs - 1 g = (1.01)**yrs - 1  The same calculations go into the 30-year depreciation rate. A unit of capital, \\(Xt\\), depreciates according to \\( X{t+1} = (1-\\delta)X_t \\). Positing a 10 percent annual depreciation rate, the 30-year \\( \\delta \\) solves \\( 1 - \\delta = .9^{30} \\).\ndelta = 1 - 0.90**yrs print(delta) 0.9576088417247838  This is a small value, which must serve as the motivation for the baseline models we read about in books to consider full depreciation.\nWe are now in position to calculate whether the economy demonstrates dynamic inefficiency:\nrstar = ((1+beta)/beta)*(alpha/(1-alpha))*(1+g)*(1+n) - delta print(rstar) 0.2696055232612754 gY = (1+n)*(1+g)-1 check = rstar \u0026lt; gY check_dist = gY - rstar print(check) print(check_dist) True 0.29578631873675876  Yes, reasonable parameter values deliver dynamic inefficiency.

If the steady-state capital stock exceeds the golden-run level, a decrease in the capital stock increases steady-state consumption. This is because the capital stock has become so large that its productivity is outweighed by the amount of resources that have to be used up each period just to provide the newborn with the existing level of capital per worker: the economy staggers under the weight of the need to maintain the per-capita capital stock constant.\n  MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\\\(','\\\\)']], displayMath: [['$$','$$'], ['\\[','\\]']], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true, skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'], TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \"AMS\" }, extensions: [\"AMSmath.js\", \"AMSsymbols.js\"] } } }); ","date":1507161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507161600,"objectID":"cb7d37f9e2feecfa50a15ab5a15aa390","permalink":"/2017/10/05/example-of-dynamic-inefficiency-in-the-baseline-olg-model/","publishdate":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/10/05/example-of-dynamic-inefficiency-in-the-baseline-olg-model/","section":"post","summary":"Reasonable parameter values are presented that give dynamic inefficiency in the canonical OLG model.\n","tags":["ECON 605"],"title":"Example of dynamic inefficiency in the baseline OLG model","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Life expectancy refers to life expectancy at birth.

Here\u0026rsquo;s a sketch of a proof that establishes that there is a unique solution to the Bellman equation.\nThe \\( T \\) operator Let \\(B(\\Psi) \\) denote the set of bounded functions \\( R: \\Psi \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) equipped with the \\( \\sup \\) norm \\( \\lVert R \\rVert = \\sup_{\\psi \\in \\Psi} R(\\psi) \\).\nDefine the operator \\(T\\) on \\(B(\\Psi)\\) as\n\\begin{align*} (TR)(k,p,s) = \\max_{\\text{trade}, \\text{no trade}} \\Bigg\\{ \u0026amp;u(k^{N}) - pk^{N} + spk^{N} + \\beta \\mathbb{E} \\left[ R(k^{N}(1-\\delta),p^{\\prime},s^{\\prime}) | p,s \\right], \\\\\\\\ \u0026amp; u(k) + \\beta \\mathbb{E} \\left[ R(k(1-\\delta),p^{\\prime},s^{\\prime}) | p,s \\right] \\Bigg\\}. \\end{align*}\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to show that \\(T\\) maps the set of bounded functions into bounded functions and verify that it satisfies the monotonicity and discounting hypotheses of Blackwell\u0026rsquo;s sufficient conditions for a contraction (theorem 5.11). Because \\( B(\\Psi) \\) is a complete normed vector space (theorem 5.8), the contraction mapping theorem (theorem 5.10) admits one and only one fixed point \\( R^{\\star} \\in B(\\Psi) \\).1\nBounded to bounded Take any \\( R \\in B(\\Psi) \\). Since \\( R \\) is bounded, there exist \\( \\underline{R} \\) and \\( \\overline{R} \\) such that \\( \\underline{R} \\leq R(\\psi) \\leq \\overline{R} \\) for all \\( \\psi \\).\nThen\n\\begin{aligned} (TR)(k,p,s) \u0026amp;= \\max_{\\text{trade}, \\text{no trade}} \\Bigg\\{ \u0026amp;\u0026amp;u(k^{N}) - pk^{N} + spk^{N} + \\beta \\mathbb{E} \\left[ R(k^{N}(1-\\delta),p^{\\prime},s^{\\prime}) | p,s \\right], \\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp; u(k) + \\beta \\mathbb{E} \\left[ R(k(1-\\delta),p^{\\prime},s^{\\prime}) | p,s \\right] \\Bigg\\} \\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\\leq \\max_{\\text{trade}, \\text{no trade}} \\Bigg\\{ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; u(k^{N}) + pk^{N} + \\beta \\overline{R}, \\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\u0026amp; u(k) + \\beta \\overline{R} \\Bigg\\}, \\end{aligned}\nwhere the last line uses properties of the stochastic process for \\(s\\). Then\n\\begin{aligned} (TR)(k,p,s) \\leq u(k^{N}) + pk^{N} + \\beta \\overline{R}, \\end{aligned}\nassuming that \\(u\\) is increasing. As long as \\(u\\) is bounded (meaning \\(u(k^{N}) \u0026lt; M\\) for some \\(M \\in \\mathbb{R} \\)), we\u0026rsquo;ve established that \\(T\\) is bounded above.\nAlong the same lines,\n\\begin{align} (TR)(k,p,s) \\geq \\max_{\\text{trade}, \\text{no trade}} \\Bigg\\{ \u0026amp;u(k^{1}) - pk^{N} + \\beta \\underline{R}, \\\\\\\\ \u0026amp;u(k^{1}) + \\beta \\underline{R} \\Bigg\\} \\end{align}\nwhere \\( k^{1} \\) is the lowest level of capital in the discrete state space, establishing a lower bound for \\( T \\). Therefore \\(T\\) is a self map, mapping bounded functions to bounded functions.\nSatisfying Blackwell\u0026rsquo;s sufficiency conditions for a contraction Because the space of bounded functions is complete, if we can show that \\(T\\) satisfies Blackwell\u0026rsquo;s sufficiency conditions for a contraction, we\u0026rsquo;ll have a contraction mapping on a complete metric space. The contraction mapping theorem tells us that \\(T\\) has exactly one fixed point and gives us a bound for how close we are to the exact solution using the method of successive approximation.\nMonotonicity looks straightforward. How about discounting? That?s going to be easy too. For any \\(c \\geq 0\\), the \\( \\beta c \\) part is going to come out of both expectations for the trade and no-trade options. Remark 5.8 of the ECON 605 Leahy notes applies.\nI was very lose with defining the set \\(\\Psi \\) and laying out the properties of \\( u \\), etc. These details, along with details about establishing monotonicity and discounting, are provided in several places in the notes. See, for example, Remark 5.8; sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4; the introduction to Section 11; and section 11.2. Those parts of the notes apply the theorems more rigorously.

The only catch is that \\( N_{t} = 1 \\), which might seem awkward at first. But remember: we still need to distinguish labor supply from labor demand (see, for example, remark 2.2 of the ECON 605 Stolyarov notes). Remark 9.12 goes through market clearing when money growth is constant. Starting from the household\u0026rsquo;s budget constraint, which is normally ignored by appealing to Walras\u0026rsquo;s law (see section 3 of the ECON 607 Leahy notes), we can derive the material-balance condition for the economy, establishing that one of the equations is redundant. How does money grow at a constant rate? The notes go through the case where the government\u0026rsquo;s only function is printing money that is transferred to the household through lump-sum transfers. Here\u0026rsquo;s the open question: what happens when the ownership of capital is transferred to firms that produce the final good (using no labor)?

We\u0026rsquo;ve therefore established that \\(\\tilde{k} \\) jumps up. 👍\nThe stock of capital does not jump Even though \\(\\tilde{k}\\) jumps, the capital stock does not. We used this fact when we determined whether or not \\(Y\\) or \\(\\tilde{k}\\) jumped. What about \\(k \\equiv K / N \\)? No\u0026mdash;both \\(K\\) and \\(N\\) are stocks. The reason \\(\\tilde{k}\\), a nonstandard transformation of capital per effective worker, jumps is because a technological parameter increases in the normalization.\nStock variables will not jump for the most part. And when they do, you\u0026rsquo;ll know. For example, Professor Stolyarov will set Godzilla loose on the economy to destroy part of the capital stock 🏢 💥 💻 💥 or have a plague wreak havoc on the population, causing \\(N\\) to jump 💀\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the handout.\n MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\\\(','\\\\)']], displayMath: [['$$','$$'], ['\\[','\\]']], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true, skipTags: ['script', 'noscript', 'style', 'textarea', 'pre'], TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \"AMS\" }, extensions: [\"AMSmath.js\", \"AMSsymbols.js\"] } } }); ","date":1497830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497830400,"objectID":"40d4e14bcb78507b7f5ccae2d7532704","permalink":"/2017/06/19/determining-whether-capital-jumps/","publishdate":"2017-06-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2017/06/19/determining-whether-capital-jumps/","section":"post","summary":"A few people have asked me whether or not \\( \\tilde{k} \\) jumps in the F2014 midterm.

The ECON 605 Stolyarov notes are available here. The ECON 605 Leahy notes are available here. I made several additions to both the Stolyarov and Leahy notes, which you might find helpful.\nHere is a catalogue of the changes:\n Stolyarov notes:  The figures have been incorporated into the notes. By my count there are 61 new figures (11 from section 2, 1 from section 3, 10 from section 4, 6 from section 5, 16 from section 6, 7 from section 7, 2 from homework 3, 5 from homework 5, 3 from homework 6). Section 3 goes through an extended Uzawa theorem for the case when the machine that turns bananas into bricks improves over time. Section 8.1 discusses the correspondence between the class notes and chapter 9 in Acemoglu. In sections 9.2\u0026ndash;9.5 of Acemoglu, the capital depreciation rate is 1. A consequence of this feature of the economy is that $ K_{t+1} = I_t $, making the supply of assets equal to investment. From 102 or proposition 1.1, we know saving equals investment, which makes the supply of assets equal to saving. In other words, for this special case, \\(a_{t+1} L_{t} \\) does indeed equal saving. But in general, when the capital depreciation rate does not equal one, \\(a_{t+1} L_{t} \\) does not equal saving. \\(a_{t+1} L_{t} \\) is the demand for assets and \\( K_{t+1} = (1-\\delta) K_{t} + I_{t} \\) is the supply of assets. The only saving technology in the economy is capital, which takes the form of non-depreciated capital and new capital, or investment. This fact is discussed on slide 16 / 27 of Lecture_12_OLG_intro.pdf and exercise H6.2, item (b). Part 5 of the notes are answers to questions that I\u0026rsquo;ve written up since the end of the semester.  Leahy notes:  Section 14 provides some remarks about the final. These are not optimal answers in many ways, although they may offer some economic content. Section 3 considers the McCall search model without dynamic programing. It derives several comparative statics, including the effect that the flow value of unemployment and patience have on the reservation wage in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Section 3.2.3 allows for the possibility of quits. Section 3.4 derives the probability distribution of the waiting time until a job is accepted. The derivation uses a pretty, pretty, pretty cool variant of the geometric series. Comparative statics for the mean waiting time with respect to the flow benefit of unemployment and patience is given sections 3.4.2.1 and 3.4.2.2. Section 12.2.2 log-linearizes the continuous-time neoclassical growth model to illustrate you can just about log-linearize anything, which is a frequent solution technique in macro. Section 3.5 extends the McCall search model to allow for exogenous separations. It is shown that the reservation wage with separations is less than the reservation wage without separations\u0026mdash;there is no reason to hold out for a high-paying job when there is a high probability that the job ends and the worker is forced to search for work through unemployment.    There are probably several other additions that I forgot to catalogue. And don\u0026rsquo;t forget that Parts 5 and 6 of the ECON 605 Leahy notes were primarily covered in ECON 607 with Professor Leahy, as 607 was a continuation of 605.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target.
