Specifically, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in the regressions $$ \\text{inflation}_t = \\alpha + \\beta \\; \\text{unemployment rate}_t + \\varepsilon_t $$ for each of the inflation series. We\u0026rsquo;re interested in reporting the $ \\beta $s.\nTo do so, we need to get the data in this form:\ndat \u0026lt;- dat %\u0026gt;% left_join(ur, by = \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;) head(dat)  ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## # Groups: symbol [1] ## symbol date price infl series_name ur ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 CPIAUCSL 1961-01-01 29.8 1.60 All items 6.6 ## 2 CPIAUCSL 1961-02-01 29.8 1.46 All items 6.9 ## 3 CPIAUCSL 1961-03-01 29.8 1.46 All items 6.9 ## 4 CPIAUCSL 1961-04-01 29.8 0.914 All items 7 ## 5 CPIAUCSL 1961-05-01 29.8 0.913 All items 7.1 ## 6 CPIAUCSL 1961-06-01 29.8 0.777 All items 6.9  tail(dat)  ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## # Groups: symbol [1] ## symbol date price infl series_name ur ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 CPILFESL 2018-12-01 260. 2.21 Less food and energy 3.9 ## 2 CPILFESL 2019-01-01 261. 2.15 Less food and energy 4 ## 3 CPILFESL 2019-02-01 261. 2.08 Less food and energy 3.8 ## 4 CPILFESL 2019-03-01 261. 2.04 Less food and energy 3.8 ## 5 CPILFESL 2019-04-01 262. 2.07 Less food and energy 3.6 ## 6 CPILFESL 2019-05-01 262. 2.00 Less food and energy 3.6  Now we\u0026rsquo;re interested in a function that regresses infl on ur and returns the coefficient on ur. The input of the function will be data frame. We\u0026rsquo;re interested in data frames because there are essentially two datasets, one for each of the inflation series. This is done using R\u0026rsquo;s nest, which creates a new data structure:\ndat \u0026lt;- dat %\u0026gt;% group_by(series_name) %\u0026gt;% nest() dat  ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## series_name data ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; ## 1 All items \u0026lt;tibble [701 x 5]\u0026gt; ## 2 Less food and energy \u0026lt;tibble [701 x 5]\u0026gt;  Each row of the data column is data frame:\ndat$data[[1]]  ## # A tibble: 701 x 5 ## symbol date price infl ur ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;date\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 CPIAUCSL 1961-01-01 29.8 1.60 6.6 ## 2 CPIAUCSL 1961-02-01 29.8 1.46 6.9 ## 3 CPIAUCSL 1961-03-01 29.8 1.46 6.9 ## 4 CPIAUCSL 1961-04-01 29.8 0.914 7 ## 5 CPIAUCSL 1961-05-01 29.8 0.913 7.1 ## 6 CPIAUCSL 1961-06-01 29.8 0.777 6.9 ## 7 CPIAUCSL 1961-07-01 29.9 1.25 7 ## 8 CPIAUCSL 1961-08-01 29.9 1.11 6.6 ## 9 CPIAUCSL 1961-09-01 30.0 1.25 6.7 ## 10 CPIAUCSL 1961-10-01 30.0 0.773 6.5 ## # ... with 691 more rows  Now we\u0026rsquo;re interested in a function that takes one of these data frames as inputs.\nmy_reg \u0026lt;- function(df) { fit \u0026lt;- lm(infl ~ ur, data = df) # Return the unemployment-rate coefficient return(fit$coefficients[[\u0026quot;ur\u0026quot;]]) }  And we want to use R\u0026rsquo;s map function to return the coefficients:\ndat \u0026lt;- dat %\u0026gt;% mutate(coefficient = map(data, my_reg)) %\u0026gt;% unnest(coefficient) dat  ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## series_name data coefficient ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 All items \u0026lt;tibble [701 x 5]\u0026gt; 0.230 ## 2 Less food and energy \u0026lt;tibble [701 x 5]\u0026gt; 0.371  The dataset now contains the coefficients from the two regressions.\n","date":1560556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560556800,"objectID":"d3b835730e896cbf4ca41eebfb8b7e6d","permalink":"/2019/06/15/many-models-in-r/","publishdate":"2019-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/06/15/many-models-in-r/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction This is an example of using R to run many regressions and collect a single regression coefficient from each model.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372651200,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
