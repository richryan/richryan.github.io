Notes on economies under the rubric of classical monetary models were added to the
[ECON 607 Ottonello notes](https://umich.box.com/s/xczz87igzno3lzpfkapiurrp8izzivud).
They are included in section section 9, which is new.

A couple of ideas worth considering:

1. Remark 9.14 suggests that technology is largely ignorable since  we can work with a transformed model.
The only catch is that \\( N_{t} = 1 \\), which might seem awkward at first.
But remember: we still need to distinguish labor _supply_ from labor _demand_
(see, for example, remark 2.2 of the [ECON 605 Stolyarov notes](https://umich.box.com/s/3x06wji3k2mkmwrcbdggwlrq410vtg0g)).
2. Remark 9.12 goes through market clearing when money growth is constant.
Starting from the household's budget constraint,
which is normally ignored by appealing to Walras's law (see section 3 of the ECON 607 Leahy notes),
we can derive the material-balance condition for the economy,
establishing that one of the equations is redundant.
3. How does money grow at a constant rate?
The notes go through the case where the government's only function is printing money that is transfered to the household through lump-sum transfers.
4. Here's the open question: what happens when the ownership of capital is transferred to firms that produce the final good (using no labor)?
This market structure adds a variation to the list in remark 3.1 of the
[ECON 607 Ottonello notes](https://umich.box.com/s/xczz87igzno3lzpfkapiurrp8izzivud).
Remark 3.4 of the [ECON 607 Leahy notes](https://umich.box.com/s/0tvft1t167we2xsn2xp4uacetoy5gcyw) talks about this idea too.
It will use the machinery in section 3.1.4.3 of the [ECON 607 Ottonello notes](https://umich.box.com/s/xczz87igzno3lzpfkapiurrp8izzivud).[^fn1]
You should see it right away---if not, let me know and we'll get it straightened out.


Keep grinding.
You're almost there.

[^fn1]: I mistakenly said this was like a capital-leasing firm in an earlier version of this post. Of course not---the firm produces bananas; it does not rent bricks to banana-producing firms. This was corrected on 7/18 at 6:40 pm.
