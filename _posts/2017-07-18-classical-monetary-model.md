Notes on economies under the rubric of classical monetary models were added to the
[ECON 607 Ottonello notes](https://umich.box.com/s/xczz87igzno3lzpfkapiurrp8izzivud).
They are included in section section 9, which is new.

A couple of ideas worth considering:

1. Remark 9.14 suggests that technology is largely ignorable since  we can work with a transformed model.
The only catch is that \\( N_{t} = 1 \\), which might seem awkward at first.
But remember: we still need to distinguish labor _supply_ from labor _demand_
(see, for example, remark 2.2 of the [ECON 605 Stolyarov notes](https://umich.box.com/s/3x06wji3k2mkmwrcbdggwlrq410vtg0g)).
2. Remark 9.12 goes through market clearing when money growth is constant.
Starting from the household's budget constraint,
which is normally ignored by appealing to Walras's law (see section 3 of the ECON 607 Leahy notes),
we can derive the material-balance condition for the economy,
establishing that one of the equations is redundant. 
3. How does money grow at a constant rate?
The notes go through the case where the government's only function is printing money that is transfered to the household through lump-sum transfers.
4. Here's the open question: what happens when the ownership of capital is transferred to a capital-leasing firm?
This market structure is covered in section 7.4 of the [ECON 605 Stolyarov notes](https://umich.box.com/s/3x06wji3k2mkmwrcbdggwlrq410vtg0g),
so we just need to incorporate that machinery into an RBC context.
Remark 3.4 of the [ECON 607 Leahy notes](https://umich.box.com/s/0tvft1t167we2xsn2xp4uacetoy5gcyw) talks about this idea.
