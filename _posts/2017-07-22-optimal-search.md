A section on a worker's optimal search decision was added to the [ECON 607 Ottonello notes](https://umich.box.com/s/xczz87igzno3lzpfkapiurrp8izzivud).
They are included in section section 13, under the part titled "Odds and ends".

The notes further unpack the question on directed search from the 607 final.
The difference between a contract, a wage, and an offer is made clear (hopefully).
Properties of the worker's decision problem are formally established.
The properties align with our intuition about on-the-job search.
