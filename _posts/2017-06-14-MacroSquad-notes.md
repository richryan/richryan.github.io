ECON 605 notes are uploaded.
<!-- The ECON 605 Stolyarov notes are available [here](https://umich.box.com/s/3x06wji3k2mkmwrcbdggwlrq410vtg0g). -->
<!-- The ECON 605 Leahy notes are available [here](https://umich.box.com/s/qwizsx7l6ejrnzdunmrckznnwhge2h9y). -->
I made several additions to both the Stolyarov and Leahy notes,
which you might find helpful.

Here is a catalogue of the changes:
* Stolyarov notes:
  1. The figures have been incorporated into the notes.
  By my count there are 61 new figures
  (11 from section 2, 1 from section 3, 10 from section 4, 6 from section 5, 16 from section 6,
    7 from section 7, 2 from homework 3, 5 from homework 5, 3 from homework 6).
  2. Section 3 goes through an extended Uzawa theorem for the case when
  the machine that turns bananas into bricks improves over time.
  3. Section 8.1 discusses the correspondence between the class notes and chapter 9 in Acemoglu.
  In sections 9.2--9.5 of Acemoglu, the capital depreciation rate is 1.
  A consequence of this feature of the economy is that \\( K_{t+1} = I_t \\),
  making the supply of assets equal to investment.
  From 102 or proposition 1.1, we know saving equals investment,
  which makes the supply of assets equal to saving.
  In other words, for this special case, \\(a_{t+1} L_{t} \\) does indeed equal saving.
  But in general, when the capital depreciation rate does not equal one,
  \\(a_{t+1} L_{t} \\) does not equal saving.
  \\(a_{t+1} L_{t} \\) is the demand for assets and \\( K_{t+1} = (1-\delta) K_{t} + I_{t} \\) is the supply of assets.
  The only saving technology in the economy is capital, which takes the form of non-depreciated capital and new capital,
  or investment.
  This fact is discussed on slide 16/27 of Lecture_12_OLG_intro.pdf and exercise H6.2, item (b).
  4. Part 5 of the notes are answers to questions that I've written up since the end of the semester.
* Leahy notes:   
  1. Section 14 provides some remarks about the final.
  These are not optimal answers in many ways, although they may offer some economic content.
  2. Section 3 considers the McCall search model without dynamic programing.
  It derives several comparative statics, including the effect that the flow value of unemployment and patience have on the reservation wage in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
  Section 3.2.3 allows for the possibility of quits.
  3. Section 3.4 derives the probability distribution of the waiting time until a job is accepted.
  The derivation uses a pretty, pretty, pretty cool variant of the geometric series.
  Comparative statics for the mean waiting time with respect to the flow benefit of unemployment and patience is given sections 3.4.2.1 and 3.4.2.2.
  4. Section 12.2.2 log-linearizes the continuous-time neoclassical growth model to illustrate you can just about log-linearize anything, which is a frequent solution technique in macro.
  5. Section 3.5 extends the McCall search model to allow for exogenous separations.
  It is shown that the reservation wage with separations is less than the reservation wage without separations---there is no reason to hold out for a high-paying job when there is a high probability that the job ends and the worker is forced to search for work through unemployment.

There are probably several other additions that I forgot to catalogue.
And don't forget that Parts 5 and 6 of the ECON 605 Leahy notes were primarily covered in ECON 607 with Professor Leahy,
as 607 was a continuation of 605.
Notes for the Stolyarov review are also posted [here](https://umich.box.com/s/14r5lvjjoq9wwz0d6mor8jn49v6vig5g).
