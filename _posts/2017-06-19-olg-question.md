A few comments were added to section P11 of the
[ECON 605 Stolyarov notes](https://umich.box.com/s/3x06wji3k2mkmwrcbdggwlrq410vtg0g)
that address the OLG question from the 2007 macro prelim.
The economy is a special case of the economy discussed is section 8.
The comments address the scope for rolling over government debt.

I also posted the suggested answers to the 605 midterm to the 605 Canvas website in the "Section stuff" directory.
