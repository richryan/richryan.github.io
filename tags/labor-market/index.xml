      <description>Here are initial-claims data, which were covered in a recent NY Times article. I try and replicate a few of the figures detailed in the article.
Data on initial claims are available at FRED by browsing data by Category &amp;gt; Population, Employment, &amp;amp; Labor Markets &amp;gt; Weekly Initial Claims and selecting Initial Claims.
Here is the R code for retrieving and plotting these data. Data on initial claims from March are highlighted in orange.</description>
